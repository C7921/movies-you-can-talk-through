The ultimate collection of films that don't mind if you skip the plot for the popcorn!

## What's the vibe?

Celebrate glorious cinematic expereriences where:

* **Nicolas Cage's hair** deserves its own Oscar category
* **Dragons meet machine guns** and nobdy questions it (looking at you, Reign of Fire)
* **The laws of physics** are gentle suggestions
* **One-liners** are delivered with magnificent cheese that the nachos get jealous
